    <p id="first_paragraph" class="content_paragraph"> “Digital technologies present paradoxes for and to all of us: the wonders of technological change are held as keys to a better future but none has yet brought utopia, and many have made life more precarious, all overshadowed by the as yet mostly unknown consequences of the development of artificial intelligence.

    <p id="second_paragraph" class="content_paragraph">“Gen Zers hold on to a hope that their different vision and values, and their clear-eyed recognition of what is wrong with society, will lead to something radically new and better than before. With added understanding of how and why they experience the world as they do, and with appreciation for the challenges they face, those of us who are in different generations might learn from that hope and join them as they work to build a better digital age future for themselves and the generations that follow. “OK Boomer” need not remain words of disappointment and disillusion. With more understanding, they can also morph into words of intergenerational connection, cooperation, and collaboration.”
