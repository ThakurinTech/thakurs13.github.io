  <h1>Digital Technologies and Gen-Z</h1>

  <p id="first_paragraph" class="content_paragraph"> Digital technologies present paradoxes for and to all of us: the wonders of technological change are held as keys to a better future but none has yet brought utopia, and many have made life more precarious, all overshadowed by the as yet mostly unknown consequences of the development of artificial intelligence. While the internet brings access to a vast resource of information, contacts, networks, connections, and the possibility of more voice and agency, it also brings vulnerability as privacy and security are compromised.</p>
        
  <p id="second_paragraph" class="content_paragraph">Gen Zers hold on to a hope that their different vision and values, and their clear-eyed recognition of what is wrong with society, will lead to something radically new and better than before. With added understanding of how and why they experience the world as they do, and with appreciation for the challenges they face, those of us who are in different generations might learn from that hope and join them as they work to build a better digital age future for themselves and the generations that follow. “OK Boomer” need not remain words of disappointment and disillusion. With more understanding, they can also morph into words of intergenerational connection, cooperation, and collaboration.</p>
  
  <p id="third_paragraph" class="content_paragraph">Even though they may not be aware of it, Gen Z is having an amazing impact on business. Just out of college, this generation has lived a diverse set of experiences spurred on by the last four years. It’s their turn to bring a fresh set of eyes and ask questions others may be afraid to ask, like, “Why do we do it this way?” and, “Why don’t we challenge the status quo?” It’s up to leaders to listen and give this generation the opportunity to be tenacious, lead with passion, and make an impact.</p>
